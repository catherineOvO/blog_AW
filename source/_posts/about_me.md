Hello World! 

I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Alan Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). I am a member of [Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/).

I obtained B.S. in [Electronic and Information Engineering](http://english.eic.hust.edu.cn/) at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) in 2019.

My research mainly focus on Vision with Graphics, including analysis-by-synthesis, differentiable rendering, robust vision, and pose estimation.
